# 🕵️‍♂️ Deep Research Agent

A powerful, autonomous research assistant built with **LangGraph**, **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, and **Streamlit**. This agent takes a user topic, plans a multi-step research strategy, crawls the web for information, and synthesizes a professional Markdown report (with PDF export).

## 🚀 Features

*   **Autonomous Planning**: Breaks complex topics into distinct, search-optimized queries.
*   **Deep Web Scraping**: Uses **DuckDuckGo** for privacy-focused searching and **Trafilatura** for robust content extraction.
*   **Cyclic Research Workflow**: Implements a feedback loop that continues researching until the plan is complete.
*   **AI Synthesis**: Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to read, summarize, and compile findings into a cohesive report.
*   **Interactive UI**: A beautiful Streamlit chat interface with real-time progress tracking.
*   **PDF Export**: Download your final research reports directly as PDFs.
*   **Cost-Effective**: Designed to run entirely with a **free** Google API Key (no OpenAI or paid search APIs required).

## 🛠️ Architecture

The agent is built as a state machine using **LangGraph**:

1.  **Planner Node**:
    *   Input: User Topic.
    *   Action: Generates a 3-step search plan.
2.  **Research Node** (Loop):
    *   Action: Executes the current search query.
    *   Search: DuckDuckGo (Top 3 results).
    *   Scrape: Extracts main text content from URLs.
    *   Summarize: Gemini condenses the scraped content.
    *   State Update: Appends summary to context, advances index.
3.  **Manager Logic**:
    *   Check: Are there more queries in the plan?
    *   Routing: If yes $\rightarrow$ Loop back to *Research Node*. If no $\rightarrow$ Proceed to *Writer Node*.
4.  **Writer Node**:
    *   Action: Compiles all summaries into a final Markdown report.

## 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pypi-ahmad/ai-research-assistant.git
    cd ai-research-assistant
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # Mac/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🔑 Configuration

You only need one API key: **Google Gemini API Key**.

1.  Get your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```
    *Alternatively, you can enter the key directly in the Streamlit sidebar.*

## 🖥️ Usage

### Option 1: Web Interface (Streamlit)
The recommended way to use the agent.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
*   Opens in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
*   Enter your topic in the chat.
*   Watch the agent plan and research in real-time.
*   Download the final PDF.

### Option 2: CLI Mode
Run the agent directly in your terminal.

```bash
python main.py
```
*   Follow the prompts to enter your API key (if not in `.env`) and research topic.
*   The final report will be saved as `final_report.md`.

## ⚠️ Limitations

*   **Rate Limits**: The free Gemini API has rate limits. If you hit them, the agent may pause or fail.
*   **Scraping**: Some websites block automated scrapers. The agent is designed to skip these and continue with other sources.
*   **Hallucinations**: Like all LLMs, the agent may occasionally hallucinate. Always verify critical facts from the original sources (URLs are usually cited in logs).
